### Contributing

If you want to contribute to Betterlance, that's cool!

As a starter, take a look into the issues for an overview of open tasks and fork the `development` branch if you want to work on the app.

If you have any ideas or want to report a bug, just open an issue.

As of now, I'm working on an SQL script that you can run in your Supabase instance for cloning the backend.
